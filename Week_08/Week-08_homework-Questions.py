# Implement a tuple of elements of all the 4 different data types, 3 examples of each type
       # str
       # bool
       # int
       # float

# Loop through the above list and print elements individually only if they are integers

# Slice the tuple at places where you find a type change

# Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.
        # Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
        # Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

# Write a python script which generates a random number between 0 and 13.
# Check if the random number is prime or not by passing it to a function which checks for prime number and returns true or false.

# Convert this json to dict  j = '{"error": {"code": 400, "message": "Bad Request"}}'

# Update the value of code to 300 in the above converted dict

# Write a program which gives the maximum sum of the consecutive elements in entire number list
        # Sample input list : [12, 1, 7, 6 , 8 , 2, 9 , 2, 11]
        # Expected result : 14
        # Reason : (12+1=13,1+7=8,7+6=13,6+8=14,8+2=10,2+9=11,9+2=11,2+11 = 13 )

# Write a program which gives the elements, whose sum is maximum sum of the consecutive elements in entire number list
        # Sample input list : [12, 1, 7, 6 , 8 , 2, 9 , 2, 11]
        # Expected result : 6,8
        # Reason : (12+1=13,1+7=8,7+6=13,6+8=14,8+2=10,2+9=11,9+2=11,2+11 = 13 )
